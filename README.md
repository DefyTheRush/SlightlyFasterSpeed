# SlightlyFasterSpeed
An SCP:SL EXILED Plugin that grants you SCP-207 speed!

Drop it in the following places (depending on your operating system) and dodge SCP's without worrying about health drains!
- %appdata%/Roaming/Plugins (Windows)
- ~/.config/Plugins (Linux)

Config Variables:
- slightlyfasterspeed_enable: (true or false)

Remote Admin Commands:
- fastspeed (id) - (Grants or strips the player the ability to have SCP-207 speed)

Permission Variables:
- sfs.allow

Notes:
- This will not work on SCP classes
- This will not stack with drinking SCP-207, as speed cannot be modified internally
- This will prevent you from dying to SCP-207 if you find it and drink it
  - However, turning this ability off will allow you to die from it
